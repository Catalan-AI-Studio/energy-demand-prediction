# Interpretable Insights from Tree-Based Models using LLMs

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict electricity demand in Texas using regression models and integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate actionable insights. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project seeks to enhance energy demand forecasts, refine projections, and explore the capabilities of LLMs in analyzing and communicating model outputs.

## Objectives and Insights

### Questions Addressed by the Model

The project focuses on answering critical questions about electricity demand and pricing, including:

- **Demand and Pricing Optimization**:
  - What price adjustments can increase electricity demand?
  - What is the projected demand for tomorrow, as provided by the state of Texas?
  - Why might the state's projections be inaccurate?

- **Projection Refinement**:
  - How can a model correct state-provided projections instead of generating new ones?

### Questions Answered by Data

The project also explores leveraging raw and processed data to address broader energy questions, such as:

- Is electricity generation expected to increase or decrease next week?
- How does the mix of gas, solar, and hydro generation change throughout the year?
- Is electricity demand projected to grow year over year?

## Deliverables

### Key Outcomes

- **Automated Prompt Generation**: Python scripts to transform model outputs and processed data into inputs for LLMs.
- **Insights and Learnings**: A deeper understanding of what types of questions LLMs can reliably answer and how they can complement traditional models.
- **Exploration of New Questions**: Identify additional, unforeseen questions that LLMs and the models can help address.

### Challenges

- Ensuring that LLM-generated insights are concise, accurate, and free from hallucinations.
- Structuring data and prompts effectively for LLMs to provide meaningful outputs.
- Improving the alignment between model predictions and real-world scenarios.
